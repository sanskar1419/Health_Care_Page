            Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, involves the
            wearing away of the cartilage that caps the bones in your joints.
            Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks
            the joints, beginning with the lining of joints. Arthritis is the
            swelling and tenderness of one or more joints.

        Anyone can get osteoarthritis; however, it is more common as people age.
        Women are more likely than men to have osteoarthritis, especially after
        age 50. For many women, it develops after menopause.Osteoarthritis can't
        be reversed, but treatments can reduce pain and help you move better.For
        some people, arthritis damages one side of the knee more than the other
        side. This can cause your knee to bow inward or outward.
