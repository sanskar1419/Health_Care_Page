            The human blood contains a number of different cells that serve
            various purposes. The cells include red blood cells, white blood
            cells and platelets. Platelets are cells that are responsible for
            helping the blood clot in the event that we cut ourselves or have
            any bleeding anywhere else.In order for the platelets to function
            normally, it is important for us to be physically healthy. However,
            in certain conditions, the platelet count can reduce dramatically
            which can be a problem for overall health. If the platelet counts
            are low, it can result in not just minor bleeding from tiny cuts and
            bruises but also catastrophic bleeding inside the gut or around the
            brain.

        <h1 class="Section-heading">The Platelets:</h1>
        <p>
          In simple terms, platelets are blood-clotting cells. When there is any
          damage to the lining of blood vessels, platelets team up and stick
          together in an attempt to plug the damage. Normally, we have around
          1.5 lac to 4 lac platelets per microliter of blood. Any number lesser
          than 1.5 lac is called thrombocytopenia, while a number greater than 4
          lac is called thrombocytosis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shape of platelets is quite amazing. When platelets are inactive,
          they are shaped in the form of small plates. However, when they are
          activated by signals released from damaged blood vessels, they change
          their shape so that they become sticky and can plug any bleeding
          anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just of note, one of the causes of heart attacks is excessive
          activation of these platelets. When there is damage to the blood
          vessels within the heart, the platelets clump together and form a mass
          of platelets and other material called a thrombus. This thrombus
          completely occludes a blood vessel and can lead to a heart attack.
          Treatment that is given for such individuals are medications that
          reduce the activation of platelets and prevent them from forming these
          clumps. These drugs are called antiplatelet agents and include
          aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times, however, the platelet counts can reduce significantly. As
          mentioned earlier, this is called thrombocytopenia and is complicated
          by bleeding from sites such as the stomach, bowel and even around the
          brain. Low platelet count can occur from viral fevers, dengue fever,
          certain bone marrow conditions such as leukaemia or lymphoma,
          chemotherapy drugs that are given for cancer, certain medications and
          even excessive alcohol consumption. It is therefore important that
          natural ways be utilised for how to increase platelets.

        <h1 class="Section-heading">How COVID Can Affect Platelet Count:</h1>
        <p>
          It has been previously recorded that exhaustion and fatigue are an
          indication of a drop in your platelet count. Viral Infections result
          in the dropping of blood platelets and since Covid is also a severe
          type of viral infection, the drop in platelet count can be an early
          symptom of Covid-19. A meta-analysis of a group of covid patients
          revealed that those with a severe case of Corona had a much lower
          average platelet count than those with a milder infection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platelets have been found to play a defensive role against
          inflammatory and infectious responses from the virus. They combine
          thrombotic and immunity functions by preventing microbial infections.
          The Blood platelets interact directly with the viruses via receptors
          and engulf the aggregating pathogens and microbes. They also help in
          the formation of leukocyte aggregate and endothelial protection.
          However, the severity of the virus can cause Platelet Antibody
          Formation leading to platelet clearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is highly advised to not ignore symptoms of fatigue, exhaustion,
          and breathlessness. Many cases of covid-19 aggravate due to ignorance
          of these symptoms. The condition of having low platelets is known as
          Thrombocytopenia. Blood platelets are essential in clotting blood and
          forming plugs in blood vessel injuries. The average platelet count is
          1.5-4.5 lakhs in a healthy person. Mild covid results in a drop of
          platelets to 85,000. Severe covid infection can result in a drop of
          blood platelets to 20,000 or less, making the disease
          life-threatening. Early detection and early diagnosis can save several
          lives.
        </p>
        <h1 class="Section-heading">How to Increase Platelet Count:</h1>
        <p>
          It is rather difficult to increase platelet count through diet and
          exercise alone. Sometimes, certain conditions such as dengue fever and
          viral fever may require the infusion of platelets in the form of a
          platelet transfusion given intravenously to restore normal platelet
          counts.That being said, if you are looking for how to increase
          platelet counts naturally, then the list of foods below should help
          you to some extent.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Milk</h3>
            <p>
              We all know that milk is a rich source of calcium and protein and
              is important in maintaining the strength of bones and muscles in
              our body. What is even more interesting is that milk contains
              vitamin K, which is an essential vitamin in the blood clotting
              mechanism in our body. Furthermore, it is believed that regular
              consumption of milk may help in improving total blood platelet
              counts. So, if you are looking for home remedies to increase
              platelets, make sure you have a glass of milk regularly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Green Leafy Vegetables:</h3>
            <p>
              Green leafy vegetables are at their source of vitamin K, which I
              have mentioned earlier to be essential in the blood-clotting
              pathway. But they also have the property of increasing platelet
              counts to some extent. In addition to just parsley, basil, spinach
              and celery, other vegetables such as asparagus, cabbage and
              watercress are also useful in increasing platelet count.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Papaya Leaf Extract:</h3>
            <p>
              This is probably the most well-known remedy for low platelet
              counts. If you are looking for how to increase platelet count
              during dengue fever, then consuming a glass or two of papaya leaf
              extract regularly can do the trick. It is not clear how this
              really works, but clinical trials have clearly demonstrated a
              significant benefit of papaya leaf extract in increasing platelet
              counts in viral fever.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the juice of papaya leaf can be rather bitter and some
              people experience nausea and possibly even vomiting at times. In
              such a situation, oral medication in the form of capsules is now
              available in India that contains the same quantity of extract
              needed to boost up platelet counts.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Pomegranate:</h3>
            <p>
              The seeds of pomegranate are packed with iron and can improve
              blood counts tremendously. Pomegranate is now prescribed as a
              fruit that has to be consumed regularly if platelet counts have to
              be increased. If you are looking for how to increase platelets
              during malaria, then try having a bowl of pomegranate fruit a
              couple of times a day to give you the boost you need. Not just
              that, pomegranate also contains numerous antioxidants and vitamins
              C which can help boost immunity and help fight infections
              effectively.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Pumpkin:</h3>
            <p>
              Pumpkin is another food that has amazing properties of increasing
              platelet count. This is because it contains vitamin A, which can
              have some benefit in enhancing the number of platelets being
              produced by the bone marrow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other vitamins A rich foods such as carrots, sweet potato and kale
              are also beneficial. If you are looking for how to increase
              platelet count during pregnancy, you may want to talk to your
              doctor about increasing your intake of these foods.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Wheatgrass:</h3>
            <p>
              Wheatgrass contains high levels of chlorophyll that is
              structurally similar to the hemoglobin in our blood. It is
              extremely beneficial when it comes to boosting platelet count, but
              has additional benefits of increasing the total quantity of red
              blood cells and white blood cells in the blood. Freshly made
              wheatgrass juice can be extremely useful if you are looking for
              how to increase platelet count during chemotherapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              A low platelet count can be of concern. If you are looking for how
              to increase platelet count naturally, then try and indulge in
              these foods now and again. However, if there is a medical reason
              for the low platelet count, then you may want to speak to a
              hematologist (blood specialist) regarding getting tested to
              determine the cause of the problem.

        <h1 class="Section-heading">Conclusion:</h1>
        <p>
          Vitamin C is closely related to the level of platelets in your body.
          Vitamin C is essential to improve and maintain the immunity of your
          body. Vitamin C helps you absorb iron efficiently and increase your
          platelet count. Great sources of Vitamin C are lemons, lime, oranges,
          pineapples, etc.Folates are a type of Vitamin B. Also referred to as
          folic acid, this nutrient is beneficial for all kinds of cells in the
          body including red blood cells. Rich sources of folates include
          peanuts, oranges, kidney beans, lentils, etc.
