            Acid Reflux, commonly known as Acidity is a condition in which bile
            or stomach acids flow back into our oesophagus or food pipe and
            cause irritation. This results in a burning sensation in our chest
            which is the commonest symptom of acidity.If the aforementioned
            food-related suggestions don’t help you out, you can always try out
            some non-food related ways like sleeping on your left side! Anatomy
            has got to do a great deal with this method of dealing with acidity.

              water and drink it to relieve acidity.Black cumin seeds are
              gastro-protective. They are effective in reducing and preventing
              acidity and its symptoms like heartburn, pain, nausea, bloating,
              constipation etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Cloves</h3>
            <p>

              flatulence, indigestion, nausea, gastric irritability etc.
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>Lukewarm Water</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>
            <p>
              Apple Cider Vinegar contains proteins, enzymes and pectin making
              it a highly nutritious addition to your diet. Some people claim
              that acid reflux may be caused by reduced amounts of stomach acid
              and this vinegar can introduce more acid into the system. However,
              further research is required.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Almonds</h3>
            <p>
              Almonds are rich in nutrients and fibre, both of which may help to
              reduce the risk of heartburn and also absorb acid. Though there is
              no substantial clinical evidence for the same, the nutritional
              profile of almonds speaks for itself. In a broader sense, acidity
              issues are also linked with appetite and diet. Almonds can help
              regulate these factors due to their high nutritional value.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Jaggery</h3>
            <p>
              Jaggery contains both potassium and magnesium, a lump of jaggery
              may just be what you need to calm your roiling tummy. Potassium is
              essential for maintaining pH balance and stimulating the
              production of mucus in the stomach lining. This prevents an acid
              overload and helps relieve your symptoms. Magnesium is required
              for keeping your digestive system strong and functioning normally,
              which reduces the risk of acidity and other digestive issues.

        <h1 class="Section-heading">Conclusion:</h1>
        <p>
          If the aforementioned food-related suggestions don’t help you out, you
          can always try out some non-food related ways like sleeping on your
          left side! Anatomy has got to do a great deal with this method of
          dealing with acidity. Since the oesophagus enters from the right side
          of the stomach, laying on our left side means the lower oesophagal
          sphincter lies above the level of stomach acid. If you lie on your
          right side, the stomach acid covers this sphincter which increases the
          risk of acid reflux.Changing the position in which your sleep by
          raising the bed’s head so that the symptoms of acid reflux can be
          reduced is another home remedy that may help. Studies show that people
          who used a wedge to support and elevate their upper body had lessened
          acid reflux than those who slept in a flat manner.
